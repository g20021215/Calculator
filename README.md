# Calculator-modules
## 1.Introduction: 
  This Calculator will be constructed by several parts: Mixed computing, integration, derivative, sum, prod, non-elementary function, trignomatric, matrix. Due to time constraints, we may not be able to update all the modules listed in the near future. 
## Part1: mixed computing.
You can use Dev c++ to open the whole project. Run the code to get the value for any two double computation. Also, you can input them for many times as long as you are not input q to the console. This part is mainly accomplished by stack. we need to get the value and notation from the string. And we also set the computation priorities and the detection of the parentheses.
